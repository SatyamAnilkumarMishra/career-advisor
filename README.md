# 🧭 Career Advisor

> An AI career-intelligence platform that answers questions using your own reference documents (RAG), analyzes resumes, searches live jobs, evaluates skill gaps, and builds milestone learning roadmaps — featuring a modern Next.js web application, a FastAPI backend, an interactive CLI, and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server with LangSmith observability.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1. Setup Environment
```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
python app.py setup
# Edit .env and insert your GROQ_API_KEY or GOOGLE_API_KEY
```

The repo ships with a default reference document, `Career_Advisor_Guide_2025.pdf`, covering
resumes/ATS, interviews, negotiation, skill-building, job search, and career roadmaps. On first
run (CLI) or first `/api/documents/upload` call, it — or whatever PDF you upload — gets chunked,
embedded (`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`), and written to a persisted **ChromaDB**
vector store at `CHROMA_PERSIST_DIR` (default `chroma_db/`, gitignored). Subsequent runs reuse
that persisted index instead of rebuilding it. Delete the `chroma_db/` folder to force a rebuild,
or upload a new PDF via the Knowledge & RAG Hub in the frontend to re-index against your own
document.

### 2. Verify your keys actually work

```bash
python app.py doctor
```

Runs a live preflight in the same order a real request travels — config →
AI Provider (a real API call with your key) → embeddings → Chroma → a full
end-to-end RAG answer → job search — and prints PASS/FAIL/SKIP for each with
an actionable fix. Exits non-zero on failure, so it works in CI too. If this
passes, the app will generate responses.

`GROQ_MODEL` defaults to **`groq-latest`** (or `gemini-flash-latest` when using Gemini).
Only `GROQ_API_KEY` (or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) is required. `ADZUNA_APP_ID` / `ADZUNA_APP_KEY` are
optional — without them the Job Matcher serves the bundled dataset instead of
live listings. `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` is only needed if you set
`LANGSMITH_TRACING=true`.

### 3. Start Applications
```bash
# Start FastAPI Backend (http://127.0.0.1:8000)
python app.py api

# Start Next.js Frontend (http://localhost:3000)
npm run dev

# Or run other components:
python app.py cli         # Terminal CLI
python app.py mcp         # MCP Server (for Claude Desktop, Claude Code, etc.)
python app.py status      # Diagnostics & environment check
```

### 4. Run Test Suite
```bash
python app.py doctor          # live preflight (needs your real API key)
python -m pytest              # backend: 87 tests

npm run lint                  # eslint — clean
npm run build                 # production build
```

The web UI is responsive: below 900px the sidebar becomes an off-canvas
drawer opened by the hamburger in the topbar, grids collapse to a single
column, tap targets meet the 44px minimum, and inputs use a 16px font so iOS
Safari doesn't zoom on focus. Verified at 375/393/412/768px with no
horizontal overflow.

> **Frontend note:** `npm install` prints `npm warn deprecated eslint@9.x`.
> This is expected and safe to ignore. ESLint 9 is in maintenance mode now that
> 10 is out, but `eslint-config-next@16.3.3` bundles `eslint-plugin-react@7.37.x`,
> which crashes under ESLint 10 (`contextOrFilename.getFilename is not a function`)
> and takes the whole lint run down. Stay on 9.x until Next ships a config that
> declares ESLint 10 support. See the comment at the top of `eslint.config.mjs`.
