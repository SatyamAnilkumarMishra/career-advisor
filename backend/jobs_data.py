"""
Bundled sample job listings.

`career_tools.search_jobs()` uses these as a fallback when no live job-search
API is configured (see `Settings.has_job_search_api`), so the Job Search
Tool — and the MCP server that exposes it — works out of the box without
requiring an API key, matching the rest of this app's "degrade gracefully"
philosophy (see `rag_pipeline.py`'s general-mode fallback).

This is a small, static, illustrative dataset — not a live feed. Swap in a
real provider by setting `ADZUNA_APP_ID` / `ADZUNA_APP_KEY` in `.env`.
