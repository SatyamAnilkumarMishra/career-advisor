"""LLM provider abstraction.

Why this exists: the original codebase (`crew_config.py`) hard-wired Gemini
directly into the response-generation code path, and named the class/module
after CrewAI despite never using it — there was no real agentic behavior,
just a single-pass prompt-and-response call.

This module fixes both problems:

1. `LLMProvider` is a small abstract interface. Swapping Gemini for another
   model later means writing one new class here, not touching the RAG
   pipeline, the Streamlit UI, or the CLI. Only Gemini is implemented for now
   — no other providers were requested — but the seam is clean.

2. `decide_needs_retrieval()` is a real, minimal agentic step: before running
   a similarity search, the model is asked a small, separate yes/no question
   — "does answering this need the uploaded document, or is it general
   career guidance?" — and retrieval only runs if the answer is yes. This
   avoids polluting general questions ("what should I wear to an interview?")
   with irrelevant document chunks just because a PDF happens to be loaded.

   This project remains a single-provider RAG system with one lightweight
   decision step, not a multi-agent CrewAI pipeline — the `crewai` dependency
   has been removed accordingly (see requirements.txt and README).
